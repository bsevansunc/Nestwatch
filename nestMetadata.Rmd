# **Nest summary metadata**  
_Important! Summary nest data should only be reported if the fate of the nest is known._

**hub**: _Character_. The primary city represented within a given Neighborhood Nestwatch program. Current regions include: Atlanta, DC, Gainesville, Pittsburgh, Raleigh, and Springfield (note: states are not included within the hub designation).

**site**: _Character_. The site code for a sampling location. Site code is provided as the first four letters of the last name of the participant, the first three letters of the first name of the participant, the two-letter state code, and a number representing whether a participant has moved. For example, if Bob Reitsma lived in Silver Spring Maryland and this was his original Nestwatch site, his site code would be REITBOBMD1. If Bob moved to another address in Maryland, his new home would be site: REITBOBMD2. If sampling has persisted at his previous site, this site would remain REITBOBMD1.

**speciesNest**: _Character_. The 4-letter alpha AOU code for the observed species

**fwsMale**: _Character_. If the male was banded, this is the US Geological Service band number of the male who attended the nest.

**fwsFemale**: _Character_. If the female was banded, this is the the US Geological Service band number of the female who attended the nest.

**nestID**: _Character_. Nest ID is recorded in the order of entry. It included regional hub, year, and a sequential ID, with each component of the ID separated by a dash. For example, the 33rd nest entry in the Washington, DC regional hub for 2016 would be coded as: DC-2016-33. Entering this by hand will only be necessary before this is implemented web app portal, in which case the ID will be automatically generated.

**plotNest**: _Character_. If a site has been broken into separate spatial locations, this is the plot ID of the location.

**fateNest**: _Character_. Possibilities include:  

*  Successful
*  Successful but parasitized
*  Failed: Predated
*  Failed: Starvation
*  Failed: Human activity related
*  Failed: Weather related
*  Failed: Parasitized
*  Failed: Unknown
*  Failed: Other

**dateClutchNest**: _Character_. The date in which eggs were first layed in the nest, if observed. Use the standard date format YYYY-MM-DD, for example March 15, 2016 would be provided as 2016-03-15.

**plantSpNest**: _Character_. The species of plant in which the nest was located. Ideally this is the scientific name, if available.

**heightNest**: _Numeric (rounding = 2 decimal places)_. The distance from the base of the nest to the ground, in meters.

**dateHatch**: _Character_. The date in which the first egg hatched, if observed. Use the standard date format YYYY-MM-DD, for example March 15, 2016 would be provided as 2016-03-15.

**descriptionNest**: _Character_. A notes field providing any other information within the nest summary report.

# Nest observation metadata

**hub**: _Character_. The primary city represented within a given Neighborhood Nestwatch program. Current regions include: Atlanta, DC, Gainesville, Pittsburgh, Raleigh, and Springfield (note: states are not included within the hub designation).

**site**: _Character_. The site code for a sampling location. Site code is provided as the first four letters of the last name of the participant, the first three letters of the first name of the participant, the two-letter state code, and a number representing whether a participant has moved. For example, if Bob Reitsma lived in Silver Spring Maryland and this was his original Nestwatch site, his site code would be REITBOBMD1. If Bob moved to another address in Maryland, his new home would be site: REITBOBMD2. If sampling has persisted at his previous site, this site would remain REITBOBMD1.

**speciesNest**: _Character_. The 4-letter alpha AOU code for the observed species

**dateNest**: _Character_. The date of the observation. Use the standard date format YYYY-MM-DD, for example March 15, 2016 would be provided as 2016-03-15.

**timeNest**: _Character_. The time of the observation. Use the 24-hour clock notation. For example 7 am would be recorded as 07:00 and 8 pm would be recorded as 20:00.

**stageNest**: _Character_. The stage of the nest. This includes:  

* B: Building
* L: Laying
* I: Incubating
* H: Hatch
* N: Nestling
* F: Fledge

**adAttNest**: _Character_. The adult (if any) attending the nest during the observation. This may include:

- M: Male
- F: Female
- M+F: Male and female
- "-": No observed adult attending
- Blank: No data provided

**nEggNest**: _Integer_. The number of eggs in the nest at the time of the observation

**nYoungNest**: _Integer_. The number of hatchlings in the nest 

**notesNest**: _Character_. A notes field providing any other information in the nest observation report (e.g., information on building, age, fate, behavior).

**observerNest**: _Character_. If the nest was observed by a technician, this is the three initials of the technician who made the observation. If the nest was observed by a participant, this may simply denoted with a "p".
