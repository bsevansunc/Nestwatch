BLUEHPKGA1,2017-02-21,2750-41419,P,"I have been noticing a CACH coming to the suet feeder and feeding in an interesting way (pecking while hovering rather than perching). I have been noticing this for at least a few weeks. Today was the first time I noticed the bird was banded. Though hard to say for sure, it appears as if the birds right leg is injured. It is possible that the yellow band has begun to slip over the foot. I attempted today to capture the bird (I am a master bander) to see if it needs to be removed. I was unable to catch it today but will try later this week. I assumed the bird was yours only because that is the only active banding I know of at this location of this species. Please contact me if you want to discuss this further. If I am able to catch the bird I will email my findings to Bob Reitsma. My email is adam@atlantaaudubon.org. More info on the bird would be apprecaited"

A female Hummingbird comes every afternoon to feed on Cardinal Flower and Bee Balm.  Two nesting pairs of Goldfinch are feeding at the Thistle seed sock.  There is a lot of Black-eyed Susan. 
"
LAFOMELVA1,2015-08-09,2571-90114,P,"There is a lot of activity when peanuts, suet, safflower seed, and Thistle seed are put out at the two pole feeders.  Northern Cardinals visit.  House Wrens, English Sparrows, Blue Jays, Fish and American Crows, Pigeons, Goldfinches, and a Hummingbird.   Our terrier mix dog does not like Crows or large birds at the feeders and will bark and run down the stairs to scare them away.  He has also eaten an occasional vole, chipmunk, baby squirrel, and baby rabbit."

LAFOMELVA1,2015-09-01,2531-74543,P,"OK.  I really looked at this Catbird.  He was different from the one yesterday.  He ate no-melt suet with pepper in it.  He drank from the shallow pan that is on a pole and to the back of the yard.  This pan is shallow, about 5 ft. 3 in. off the ground, has two rocks in it and is flushed with fresh water everyday.  His eyes look clear.  He looks fat and he is alert.
The usual birds are coming to the feeders:  Mourning Doves, Bluejays, Red-headed Finches, two pairs of Goldfinches, a White-breasted Nuthatch.  But where are the House Wrens and the other banded birds? I often wonder where the birds go to get food, if they do not come to these two feeders.  The feeders are run fairly consistently throughout the year.  The food is peanuts, suet, bark butter, and safflower seeds.  Occasionally, I add a cone of nuts.  Thistle seed for Goldfinches in a sack.  Black-eyed Susan is fading.  Cardinal Flower is fading.  The Goldfinches love to land on the 14 ft. tall Sunflowers and swing back and forth.  The small birds frequently hang out in the taller of three Persimmon trees, then fly to the feeder.  Also, Chickadees hang out in the mature pine tree nearest the feeder, then come to the feeder that is closest to that bough and return to the pine tree.  I have  observed Hummingbirds totally bypass the sugar water feeder, alight and sip at Monarda, then fly straight up to the canopy of the mature elm that is 60 years old."

One Goldfinch fed and then left.  It is as if there is a stony pall over the yard.  Then I saw a fox at 5:30 p.m. walking on our street.  I followed it and watched as it attacked and got a squirrel.  I took a photo of the fox.  It has black tips on its ears.  Neighbors say they have seen two others.  But the black-tipped ears is the mark of this one.  It is sleek and fat.  It may be the fox I saw attack a group of 4 squirrels and successfully take one out and proceed to eat it behind a bush in my front yard at 9 a.m. I was seated in the front seat of my car about to go to work.  I just sat still in the car and then, it looked at me and we locked eyes.  Its eyes were golden yellow and dark around the edges."

I put up a suet and bug cone and already 4 blocks of suet.  I had to stop the bark butter because the wood peckers were slicing the bark on the Persimmon and pecking.  Catbirds are feeding furiously at the suet.  There are four. They fly in from the deeper part of the yard, perch in the Persimmon on alight on the suet."

He keeps flying back to the shrub and yelling at the invader.  The chipmunk comes and darts at the sparrow and then retreats into the shrub.  The sparrow has yet to do more than land on the outside of the shrub, he isn't going into the shrub yet."
MADJDAVPA1,2017-05-02,2661-08096,P,After the chipmunk raid yesterday we wondered if this guy would come back to his nest.  We noticed him out and about this afternoon.  He's going into the site of the nest raided by chipmunks (which is now empty of eggs and nestlings).  He seems to stay in there for a while but we haven't noticed him bringing in food or any other nesting materials.

She and her mate abandoned their excavation work in a tree stump in the back yard and relocated to a nest box. This occurred about April 18. They continue to be using the nest box. I saw them yesterday (April 24) going in and out of it. I can't tell what stage of nesting they are at. If they got straight to work and she laid eggs let's say around 4/20, I should be seeing some action by the weekend (action being lots of feeding). I hope everything survives: the box is on the side of the garage right near the house where there is a lot of human activity. Might not have been the best place to locate it. I'll keep you posted."

Young birds could just barely fly and were taking shelter in in a golden thread tree in our front yard.

SALOSHEMD1,2014-07-11,2441-96385,P,I just wanted to let Mandy know that I saw this bird of undetermined sex which she had banded on 7/1. It was carrying  nesting material around the yard and singing with its beak full. I later discovered a carolina wren nest -- probably one of their famous dummy nests -- in my herb box right outside the kitchen door. A beautifully built nest that I will definitely show the grandchildren when they come later this week.

LAFOMELVA1,2017-10-31,2651-56296,P,"Leaves are falling.  A big storm hit in the night with 50 mile and hour winds and rain. Large branches fell from the Sugar Maple.  The day before the feeders were still - White-breasted Nuthatch, unbanded Chickadees, Finches, English Sparrows.  Broad-winged Hawk spotted over Little Falls Road, so this could be the reason for the stillness in the backyard.  A large woodland edge spider still has its web up, Chipmunks and Squirrels active. Fox spotted on the street at 11 p.m. on 10/23/17.  Delphinium still in bloom.  Do not see Honey Bees, nor Bumblebees. Leaves are falling.  Putting seeds into the beds and putting beds to sleep.  Many earthworms in many parts of the yard.  Cardinal Flower still has small blooms.  Taking the Hummingbird feeder down today.  Happy Halloween."
RESIMARPA1,2017-09-16,2711-77328,P,Please simplify your data entry. It was bad last year and now you have added this verify thing which takes even longer. It would be so much easier if I could put in all the resighting dates for the same bird without reentering my information and the band information. Project feeder watch from Cornell is so much easier.
LAFOMELVA1,2017-12-06,2651-56295,P,"The Cardinal was feeding at the window feeder with safflower. Red-headed finches, Chickadees, House Sparrows, Carolina Wrens have been seen. The garden is asleep. Fox sighted at pond at 11 p.m. The neighbor's dog was barking furiously with a frightful tone. I had hoped to see St. Nicholas (the Czech Santo who is skinny),who comes the night of December 5, but was more surprised. Rats and squirrels sighted. The Juncos have come. An immature Red-tailed hawk was sighted at Tuckahoe Park while I was doing an Ivy pull, hence a brief silence in the p.m. one day last week. There are some sparrows that are different coming to yard. Can't identify the little brown guys. Will do the Christmas bird count for Arlington - 6 parks. Red-headed Finches are here. A phlox bloomed last week. A Heath Aster bloomed a small flower. Salvia still in bloom - 1 spike. Milkweed in seed. Monarda in seed. Coreopsis and Coneflower in seed. Rabbits got some Asters. Planted four types of native shade plants and they are doing well. I've kept a big wood pile in the back for cover for birds and also let the bush by my window get bushy for cover. Saw a lot of Sparrows in the bush all puffed up. Providing Black oil Sunflower seeds, Safflower seeds, suet, and hulled peanuts. See city pigeons, American Crows, and White -breasted Nuthatch. Hairy and Downy woodpeckers and a small flitty bird - Red-crested Kinglet? Don't know. Goldfinches come to suet. Lots of Earthworms in the soil. No more spiders. Mice have come into the house so had to set traps. Mulching and putting beds to sleep. I put up a bat house. So that is the picture for December."

BEEGERLNC1,2017-12-10,1352-92507,P,"BANDED AMRO: metal band on left leg. Most likely, this is ""my"" AMRO from the ""Neighborhood Resight"" project. The banded robin was last seen in August, when it had just the left metal band (the orange and blue bands had already fallen off the right leg). I could not quite read the band, so there is an outside chance that it is migratory robin with a band on its left leg and is NOT the bird for this project. There is a flock of migratory robins that visit the yard. This AMRO keeps to itself, and it is a female, so most likely it is the bird with band 1352-92507. I will try to read the band with a scope at some point, but seeing the bird again will be difficult."

The garden is sleeping now. Things are in seed, mulch is going in, beds are turned, and seed heads of flowering plants have been dead headed and put into the bed with a covering of mulch. Weeding is a big job. The feeders are kept full with safflower, Black OIl Sunflower, suet, bark butter balls with cayenne pepper, and hulled peanuts. There are four squirrels who come down to raid the feeders. Four large branches fell from the big Silver Maple and I fear we will need to take it down in the next 5 years. It is more than 60 years old. I have Oak, Chinquapin, and Maple growing. The Strawberry Bush provided flowers and food. The Beauty Berry bushes have berries. The pond is running and has minnows in it . Wlliamsburg Middle School Pond will be saved. A teacher is using my pond plan . Now is the time when I walk around the neighborhood and take pictures of birds nests and record the location - just for personal curiousity,"
LAFOMELVA1,2017-12-14,2711-77143,P,"The wren was singing at 10:00 am today in 39degree F. partly cloudy weather. Cardinals came later. Early in the morning in the dark of dawn, there are little dark birds smaller than Sparrows that come and feed on the ground. I have laid out straw from the Halloween bails I had to lay grass seed and encourage grass growth. These birds pick among the straw. I put out fresh thistle seed, thinking perhaps they were Goldfinches in winter phase. I can put a vegetable shortening and safflower seed feeder ball in the Glouca tree and watch the Goldfinches come to feed before the squirrels get it. It is cold and there is a slight wind."

LAFOMELVA1,2017-12-24,2711-77143,P,"I was laying mulch and pully invasivies when I turned to see the Carolina Wren at the feeder taking safflower seed. It suddenly jumped down and a flew in through the lattice and under the porch. Within a few seconds a Sharp-shinned Hawk flew into the big Sugar Maple in the tree. Who says winter is a dead time. Also, little wrens in the morning are Winter Wrens. Yellow-throated Sparrows are coming into the yard. I did the the Christmas Bird Count for Audubon for 6 parks in the area and put in the data. Tuckahoe Park and Lacy Woods had the most diversity. Tuckhaoe is only three blocks from the backyard. Tuckahoe had an immature Red-tailed Hawk perch in the big Oak trees, flocks of Robins, Carolina Wrens (unbanded), White-breasted Nutcatch, and Red-headed Finches, and Cardinals. Also, a Bald Eagle flew over the park headed west at a fast paste. I was with two other birders and they confirmed the sighting."

GRIFRACMA1,2015-06-13,1212-36664,P,This bird and the female NOMO banded last year (135263516) have nested together again and fledged two chicks this year.
GRIFRACMA1,2015-08-21,1891-11072,P,"This bird is now missing both the Aluminum and Purple bands, but still has the Red."
GRIFRACMA1,2016-02-29,1891-11072,P,"This is the same cardinal we've been resighting that apparently removed his left leg bands, and now has only the red on his right."
GRIFRACMA1,2016-03-17,1212-36664,P,This is the male Mockingbird who's been a regular visitor for several years. He lost the purple band several years ago.
GRIFRACMA1,2016-03-24,1352-63516,P,She and the banded male (121236664) seem to be pairing up again.

GRIFRACMA1,2017-05-03,2641-85630,P,Missing Orange band. Will report Red as left leg top band going forward.
GRIFRACMA1,2017-05-05,2651-43465,P,"Bird seems to be having trouble with his right leg. Toes are curled up, and he repeatedly sets it down and lifts it up again very quickly. Also, though this may not be related, the Gray band appears stuck high up on the leg. Update to previous sighting: Gray band has dropped into place above red band.
